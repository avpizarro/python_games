# Python Pygame Exercises

This repository contains exercises and small games created using **Pygame** as part of a learning process. The two main projects included are **Telebolito** (a Pong-style game) and **Flight 714** (a simple flight movement simulation).

## 🚀 Projects Included
### **1️⃣ Telebolito**
A classic **Pong-style** game where you control a paddle, and the computer controls the other. The goal is to bounce the ball and score points against the AI opponent.

### **2️⃣ Flight 714**
A simple game where you control an airplane, moving it around the screen while keeping it within boundaries.

## 📌 Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-game.git
   cd python-game
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Run the Games

### **Run Telebolito**
```bash
python3 telebolito.py
```
### **Run Flight 714**
```bash
python3 game.py
```

## 🎮 Controls
### **Telebolito (Pong-Style Game)**
- **⬆️ UP Arrow**: Move paddle up
- **⬇️ DOWN Arrow**: Move paddle down

### **Flight 714 (Plane Movement)**
- **⬅️ LEFT Arrow**: Move left
- **➡️ RIGHT Arrow**: Move right
- **⬆️ UP Arrow**: Move up

## 🛠️ Features & Future Improvements
✅ Randomized ball movement direction in Telebolito  
✅ AI-controlled paddle movement  
✅ Speed increases after a set number of points  
✅ Player-controlled airplane movement in Flight 714  

### 🔜 Planned Improvements:
- Implement scoring UI for Telebolito
- Add sound effects to both games
- Improve AI paddle movement strategy
- Implement more realistic physics for Flight 714
